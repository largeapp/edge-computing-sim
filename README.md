# Mobile edge computing simulation
This is a repository of Edge-computing-sim for mobile edge computing simulation. The first version of Edge-computing-sim was developed by Yanfeng He, as an undergraduate graduation project (September 2019-June 2020), under the guidance of Dr. Jinlong Hu.

Edge-computing-sim is an extended version of [EdgeCloudSim](https://github.com/CagataySonmez/EdgeCloudSim).

Expanded functions: 
1 Mobility, adding mobility model of edge server, adding the function of reading the movement trajectory from the file.
2 Network, adding the network topology, modifying the interface of the network module.
3 Edge server, adding the mechanism of automatic wake-up and task transmission mechanism.
4 adding energy statistics mechanism.

The codes are coming soon.
